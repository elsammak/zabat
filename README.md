This is a coffee script used to report issues annonymously, user reports to automatic bot that he suffers from something from someone & bot send him/her.

ex. 
john hate the smell of Jane, but he can't tell her. So John just send bot "zabat Jane send bad smell".
In this case, bot will send Jane that she does smell bad & she'll never get who did send it.

This script also allows sending reports at the end to the admin so he/she can make evaluations and check who is the most annoying person in the company.
